# Manual steps (script later)

* terraform init
* encountered odd .netrc issue with terraform cli, file was use for curl batch job, deleting resolved the issue
  may be worth a sanity check to see if this file exists prior to running init.
* terraform validate and fmt to format
* confirmed creation of ec2 instance, state file added to ignore.
* init is required to import/source a module.


# Some madness with configuration files and trying to use modules
* Seems as though modules are much preferred though there is some mess to configuring.
* Working on mvp for the cluster to begin and using default vpc etc.
