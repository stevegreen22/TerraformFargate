# Terraform Fargate
Playing with deploying dockerised Java app via Fargate with Terraform

## Requirements
* Simple Java App to be run as a Docker Container.
* Deployed to AWS Fargate using Terraform.
* Pull credentials from a variable file rather than vault etc
* Expand to create a CircleCI pipeline for deployment.

## Additional 
* Consider multiple AWS Accounts ans simplify deployment strategy.
* Both Terraform and Cloudwatch may be used together - how can these be syncronised?
